## About CS50x

**CS50x** is Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. The course covers topics such as:
- C programming
- Algorithms and data structures
- Memory management
- File I/O
- Debugging and testing

This repository focuses on my hands-on experience with **C**, including problem sets and personal experiments.

---

## My Goals

Through this course, I aim to:
- Gain a solid understanding of **C programming basics**
- Strengthen my problem-solving and algorithmic thinking
- Build confidence in tackling programming challenges
- Prepare for more advanced topics in computer science

## Projects & Exercises

Here are some of the notable projects and exercises I completed:

1. **Hello, World!**
   - My first C program
   - Learned compilation and execution workflow

2. **Cash**
   - Implemented an algorithm to give the minimum number of coins
   - Practiced conditional statements and loops

3. **Credit**
   - Validated credit card numbers using Luhn’s algorithm
   - Reinforced use of arrays and arithmetic operations

4. **Personal Experiments**
   - Implemented a simple calculator
   - Practiced string parsing and memory allocation

## Challenges & Reflections

- Understanding **pointers and memory management** was initially confusing, but breaking concepts into small experiments helped.
- Debugging segmentation faults taught me the importance of careful memory handling.
- Writing modular code early made later projects easier to manage.
- Time management was key—balancing problem sets with personal experimentation accelerated learning.
